Alignment tool
==============
Download Main.exe from the latest release. 
Opening Main.exe may open console depending on version, then the application will start.

Known issues:
v1.2.0 and below:
- The label for dataset names is limited in size, so long dataset names will be cut off.
- Though it is possible to acquire encoder data with the arduino code, the application cannot yet switch to this mode.
- Sampler will often not work with 'ignore limits' on OFF

v1.1.0 and below:
- Loading a csv file which contains a dataset name which is already in use will cause the dataset not be loaded.
